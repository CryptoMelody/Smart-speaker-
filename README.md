# Smart-speaker
This project and others was made a long time ago, so that's why some of the **projects doesn't have any connections!!!!!!**NOW I WILL UPLOAD ALL MY WORKS ONLY ON GITHUB AND THEY WILL INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION!

This smart speaker work on Telegram with the bot! After connecting the ESP32 and uploding the code. You just have to open the bot(this bot will have a connection with your speaker)! Another (the second) bot, which will connect with AI u can made with this website https://www.coze.com/ | Then you can make a link to your first bot and use the speaker.


***My example of design of the speaker:***
